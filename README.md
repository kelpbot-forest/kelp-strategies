# kelp-strategies

This is a compendium of custom strategies for the [Stellar network](https://www.stellar.org/) trading bot [Kelp](https://github.com/lightyeario/kelp), contributed by the Kelp user community.

Each strategy is deployment ready, meaning that it has at minimum been confirmed as compile-compatible with the Kelp core codebase and tested on the Stellar network. Each strategy's folder contains the code and documentation necessary to add that strategy to your Kelp bot.

The key standard we ask is that authors contribute only code they would trust to trade their tokens. Detailed information on contribution requirements is documented in the Contribution Guide.

### Reminder

Keep in mind the advice from Kelp's documentation: **Be Smart and Go Slow**

*Whenever you trade on Stellar, you are trading with volatile assets, in volatile markets, and you risk losing money. Use Kelp at your own risk. There is no guarantee you'll make a profit from using our bots or strategies. In fact, if you set bad parameters or market conditions change, Kelp might help you lose money very fast. So be smart and go slow.*
